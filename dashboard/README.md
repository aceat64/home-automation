# Dashboard
A simplified dashboard for home assistant, designed for my specific house/needs.

## Setup
1. You will need to modify the `dashboard.js` file so that `https://your.hass.install` points to your Home-Assisstant install.
2. Once you are done editing `dashboard.js`, recalculate it's sub-resource integrity hash and update the `index.html` file.
3. Get a google api key and update the `index.html` file to use it.
4. Access your new dashboard at: `https://your.hass.install/?key=YOUR_HASS_KEY`
